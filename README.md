# DeepLearning-Classification-

# Problem Statement
**Objective :**
To develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify images of dogs and cats. The model will analyze the given image and predict whether it contains a dog or a cat.

**Key Details :**

1.Input: Images of varying dimensions containing either a dog or a cat.
2. Output: A binary classification label:
-- 0 for Cat
-- 1 for Dog

**Challenges :**
1. Variability in image quality, lighting, and background.
2. Diversity in dog and cat breeds (e.g., size, fur patterns, and colors).
3. Similar visual features between some dogs and cats.

## Steps for Implementation

1. **Dataset Preparation :**
Collect labeled images of cats and dogs (e.g., from Kaggleâ€™s Dogs vs. Cats dataset).
Split into training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Preprocessing :**
Resize images to a standard size (e.g., 150x150 or 224x224).
Normalize pixel values to a range of [0, 1].

3. **Model Architecture :**
* Use a CNN-based architecture like:
* Custom CNN (Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense layers).
* Transfer learning models (e.g., VGG16, ResNet, MobileNet).

4. **Training :**
Use a binary cross-entropy loss function and an optimizer like Adam. Monitor performance with metrics like accuracy and precision.

5. **Evaluation :**
Evaluate the model on the test set to measure accuracy. Fine-tune hyperparameters if necessary.

6. **Deployment :**
Deploy the model as a web or mobile app for real-time classification.
